``Author: Rony varghese``

## What's done:
- Character list view :white_check_mark:
- List characters from the Star Wars universe (name, gender &amp; home
planet, people/?page=1 would suffice). :white_check_mark:

Character details view :white_check_mark:
- display: name, hair colour, eye colour, gender and home planet and list
the films that the character has appeared in :white_check_mark:
- Add appropriate unit tests :construction:

## What's pending
- Unit tests for Character details page.
- Unit tests: Improve code coverage
- Responsiveness needs to be validated and fine tuned.
- Provide the ability to amend the height or gender of a character
- Add e2e tests

## Setup Instructions

In the project directory, you can run:


### `npm install`

Installs all required dependencies for the app.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
